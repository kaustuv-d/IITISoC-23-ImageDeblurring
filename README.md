# ClearVU - an imageDeblurring GAN
## Introduction 
Image blurring is a common phenomenon caused by various factors such as motion blur, defocus blur, or camera shake. Deblurring aims to reverse this blurring effect and recover the original details and sharpness in an image. The Image Deblurring GAN is a deep learning model designed to address this problem.
The Image Deblurring GAN is a PyTorch-based model that utilizes the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to remove blurriness from images. It aims to enhance the clarity and sharpness of blurred images by learning from a training dataset.
